# NewsFeed
A news and social media feed aggregating platform that provides a colour mapped sentiment analysis of every item in the feed.<br>

If you would like to include Reddit and Twitter feed, set your API keys accordingly in API_KEYS.py<br>

The program is capable of searching through the feed, highlighting items of interest, filtering out social media feed, and enabling preset highlights.<br>
