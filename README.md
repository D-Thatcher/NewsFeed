# NewsFeed
A news and social media feed aggregating platform that provides a colour mapped sentiment analysis of every item in the feed.<br>

If you would like to include Reddit and Twitter feed, set your API keys accordingly in API_KEYS.py<br>

The program is capable of searching through the feed, highlighting items of interest, filtering out social media feed, and enabling preset highlights.<br>

If you're using Qt designer on Windows to edit the user interface, you can compile your `.ui` file to a `.py` file using the following command:<br>

`python -m PyQt5.uic.pyuic -x "path to your .ui file" -o "path to outputted .py file"`
